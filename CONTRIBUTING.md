# Contributing to the Azure Spring Apps training

As this training is [Open Source](LICENSE.txt), contributions are highly welcome!

## Images

Images have a black 5px border around them, as Azure's default theme is white and it makes it difficult to see screenshots on GitHub.

You can choose any tool to do those border, here's how we do it:

- Use the GIMP
- Go to `Filters -> Decor -> Add border...`
- Configure the border to be black and only 5 pixels width
