# 00 - Setup your environment

__This guide is part of the [Azure Spring Cloud training](../README.md)__

Setting up all the necessary prerequisites in order to expeditiously complete the lab.

## Creating Azure Resources

To save time, we provide an ARM template for creating all the Azure resources you will need for this lab other than the Azure Spring Cloud instance itself. Use the Deploy to Azure button below.

> 💡 Use the following settings for deploying the Azure Template:
>
> * Create a new resource group.
> * Set West US 2 as the location. If you want to change that region, check that Azure Spring Cloud is available in the region that you want to use.
> * Save the MySQL password you specify in this step. You will need it in section 6. If you don't set one, it will be `super$ecr3t`.

>⏱ The resource provisioning will take some time. __Do not wait!__ Continue with the workshop.

## Prerequisites

This training lab requires the following to be installed on your machine:

* [JDK 1.8](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/?&version=java-8-lts&architecture=x86-64-bit&package=jdk)
* A text editor or an IDE. If you do not already have an IDE for Java development, we recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=azurespringcloud-github-judubois) with the [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack&WT.mc_id=azurespringcloud-github-judubois).
* [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest&WT.mc_id=azurespringcloud-github-judubois) version 2.0.80 or later. You can check the version of your current Azure CLI installation by running:
  ```bash
  az --version
  ```

* The Bash shell. While Azure CLI should behave identically on all environments, some semantics may need to be modified if you use other shells. To complete this training on Windows, you can use [Git Bash that accompanies the Windows distribution of Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

* The `jq` utility. On Windows, download [this Windows port of JQ](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases) and add the following to the `~/.bashrc` file: 
   ```bash
   alias jq=<JQ Download location>/jq-win64.exe
   ```

* 🚧 The `spring-cloud` extension for Azure CLI. You can install this extension after installing Azure CLI by running `az extension add -n spring-cloud -y`.

> 💡 In sections 9 and 10, you will access the UI of the Microservice application in a Web browser. This UI does not render correctly in Internet Explorer and the pre-Chromium version of Edge. Use the [new Edge](https://microsoft.com/edge/?WT.mc_id=azurespringcloud-github-judubois), Google Chrome, or Firefox for these sections.

The environment variable `JAVA_HOME` should be set to the path of `javac` in the JDK installation.

You can then use Visual Studio Code or an IDE of your choice.

## Alternate Setup

If you do not have a prior development environment for Java on your computer and do not wish to set one up, you can [complete this training using Docker and Visual Studio Code](AlternateSetup.md).
