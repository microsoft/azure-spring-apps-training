# 00 - Setup your environment

__This guide is part of the [Azure Spring Cloud training](../README.md)__

In this section, we'll set up everything you need to expeditiously complete the training.

## Creating Azure Resources

To save time, we provide an ARM template for creating all the Azure resources you will need for this lab other than the Azure Spring Cloud instance itself. Use the Deploy to Azure button below.

> 💡 Use the following settings for deploying the Azure Template:
>
> * Create a new resource group.
> * In the location field, select the nearest region from [the list of regions where Azure Spring Cloud is available](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=spring-cloud&regions=all).
> * Save the MySQL password you specify in this step. You will need it in section 6. If you don't set one, it will be `super$ecr3t`.

>⏱ The resource provisioning will take some time. __Do not wait!__ Continue with the workshop.

## Prerequisites

This training lab requires the following to be installed on your machine:

* [JDK 1.8](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/?&version=java-8-lts&architecture=x86-64-bit&package=jdk)
* A text editor or an IDE. If you do not already have an IDE for Java development, we recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=azurespringcloud-github-judubois) with the [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack&WT.mc_id=azurespringcloud-github-judubois).

* The Bash shell. While Azure CLI should behave identically on all environments, shell semantics vary. Therefore, only bash can be used with the commands in this training. To complete this training on Windows, use [Git Bash that accompanies the Windows distribution of Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win). **Use only Git Bash to complete this training on Windows. Do not use WSL, CloudShell, or any other shell.**

* [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest&WT.mc_id=azurespringcloud-github-judubois) version 2.0.80 or later. You can check the version of your current Azure CLI installation by running:

  ```bash
  az --version
  ```

> 💡 If you try the command above and you see the error `bash: az: command not found`, run the following command: `alias az='az.cmd'` and try again.

* 🚧 The `spring-cloud` extension for Azure CLI. You can install this extension after installing Azure CLI by running `az extension add -n spring-cloud -y`. If the extension is already installed, update it to the latest version by running `az extension update -n spring-cloud`.

> 💡 In sections 9 and 10, you will access the UI of the Microservice applications in a web browser. Use the [new Edge](https://microsoft.com/edge/?WT.mc_id=azurespringcloud-github-judubois), Google Chrome, or Firefox for these sections.

The environment variable `JAVA_HOME` should be set to the path of the JDK installation. The directory specified by this path should have `bin`, `jre`, and `lib` among its subdirectories. Further, ensure your `PATH` variable contains the directory `${JAVA_HOME}/bin`. To test, type `which javac` into bash shell ensure the resulting path points to a file inside `${JAVA_HOME}/bin`.

You can then use Visual Studio Code or an IDE of your choice.
